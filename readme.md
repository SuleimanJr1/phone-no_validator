Phone number validator, a web app that validates and return the carrier network which that number is. Takes in country code too. Works only for Nigeria numbers only for now.

To do
--validate phone number initialers --done
--validate phone number lenght --done
--validate phone number carrier --done

I aslo want the background to change color, brand color of the phone number ]carrier detected.
If you start writing the number with a "+" it must be followed by "234" to be able to validate. --not done, doesn't look well.

I also want a landing page first where users see our profile first which says a little about us and also about the project work. From there a link would be made available to take you to the validator.
